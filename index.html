              The report is broken down into two sections Music, and Video. We will provide preliminary outputs and show

        <h4 class="title is-4">Step 1: Building the basics </h4>
        <p class="space-around">
          For the first part of the project we started with various symbolic music generators to generate melodic
          phrases and harmonic progressions.
          Symbolic music generators have been around for a while, especially procedural generation which predates
          computers, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel">Musikalisches
            WÃ¼rfelspiel</a>
          (often falsley attributed to Mozart). Procedural generation of music is particularly tempting due to the
          abundance of formal structures in music, from large form structures such as Symphnies, Sonatas, and 12-bar
          blues, to small scale structures outlining i.e
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint">Counterpoint</a> or Voice Leading. AI-Driven generation
          of music found early success in 2016 in models such as <a href="https://github.com/Ghadjeres/DeepBach">
            DeepBach</a>, that generated convincing 4 part chorales in the style of Bach, after being trained on about
          400 original chorales.
          Successes of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer</a> architecture in language
          generation/translation tasks has inspired a host of applications of the architecture to music generation.
          Usually (and thats the case for the two models we are using here)
          symbolic music is broken down into tokens by
          tokenizers, i.e <a href="https://github.com/Natooz/MidiTok/tree/main">Midi Tok</a>. Such a tokenizer may
          create tokens for Note-On, Note-Off, Chords, Start of Song, End of Song.
          For a more detailed overview of what a symbolic music tokenizer might encode, read the representation
          section<a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/performance-rnn">here</a>. The tokens then can be used by the
          model, much
          like language tokens.
          The first model we experimented with was the <a
            href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/piano-transformer">Magenta Piano
            Transformer</a>, we generated several outputs with the default settings and chose the following piece.

        </section>
        <section>
          <p class="space-around">The second model we used was the <a
              href="https://github.com/salu133445/mmt?tab=readme-ov-file">Multi Track Music Transformer</a>
            There are different configurations and models available, trained on different datasets. We used the previous
            output as seeds for the subsequent generation.
            We itereativley generated over 100 samples using different configurations of the seeds i.e chords only,
            chords in choir instrumentation (i.e one line per instrument, this could be interesting since the model
            takes instrumentation into account),
            melody only, and the full seed. Additionally we used 4 different models, trained on the <a
              href="https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP/database.html">Symbolic orchestral database (SOD)</a> the <a
              href="https://qsdfo.github.io/LOP/database.html">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, where one model is trained on the
            full set (LMD_full) and one on a subset ((LMD)) and the <a href="https://symphonynet.github.io/">SymphonyNet
              Dataset</a>
            Additionally for each of theese configurations 4 types of outputs where generated with different behaviour
            in resepect to the seed midi. 1) unconditioned (freely generated music, only a music start token is
            provided),
            2) instrument informed (the model knows what instruments are used in the seed), 3) 4-bar (4 bars of music
            are provided from which the model continues generating) and 4) 16- beats (16 beats are provided from which
            generation continues).
            Here are some example outputs.

          <p class="space-around">We worked the Magenta Transformer output into a shorter piano section and then into a
            electronic hip-hop (drill) style beat. The original transformer output has a strong leaning towards 6/8
            time. We decided to keep this metric subdevision, but place emphasis on every third beat, resulting in the
            12/8 meter of the final track, which works well with in this genre. The outputs of the MMT model, inspired
            the vocal arrangement in the final track.</p>

            The piece begins with a choral section: a bastardized version of the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunc_dimittis">"Nunc Dimittis"</a> a common eveing prayer. Instead of
            being released into the bliss of the heavens as in the original prayer, the future is uncertain as "mankind
            outlived its purpose" in creating AI (suo facto opus est - his work is done).
            The second part is a brief back and forth between AI and a Human. The first section is generated by <a
              href="https://chatgpt.com/"> ChatGPT </a>, with instructions regarding rhyme scheme and rhythmic patterns
            (syllables per line) to fit the rhythm of the beat. This section outlines concerns about humans having to
            live with the consequences of their decision.
            The second section is written by us, a slightly over the top, hubristic response with references to very
            real problems in using AI, such as deepfakes: "I speak through your heros, the dead come alive" or
            problematic use in <a

        <p>For the track arrangement we used <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> with different prompt
          configuration.
          We generated a total of 13 tracks, two text only prompts, the remaining 11 extending the beat above with
          different instructions regarding voicing and mood and speed, two of theese where instrumental, the rest
          included the lyrics above.
          We ended up using 4 of them in the final track, either directly or through resampling, copying the arrangement
          and extracting the vocals.
          The full list of generated tracks is compiled in the following <a

        <h4 class="title is-4">Step 4: Producing and arranging</h4>
        <p>The musical arrangement of this track was largely driven through various attempts at timbre transfer. (A
          generalisation of vocal cloning), where different qualities of two source audio files are combined into a
          third one.
          Most often this is used in speech, i.e making text spoken by one person, sound like a different person, also
          referred to as voice cloning. Since in the track rhythm and pitch are important, regular text to speech was
          not applicable here. We used three different models:
          Most extensivley we used the <a href="https://github.com/Plachtaa/seed-vc/">following repository</a>, which
          developed a voice cloning system based on <a
            href="https://bytedancespeech.github.io/seedtts_tech_report/">SEED-TTS</a> an architecture and training
          paradigm proposed by ByteDance.
          We built a <a href="https://gist.github.com/efraimdahl/2bb1bac315872cbcac9128a84b9f9ed0">small inference
            pipeline</a>, automatically iterating through different target and reference audios and different inference
          depths and settings. (I.e using pitched (F0) vs unpitched model variations).
          We generated more than 100 different combinations, starting at low inference resolutions, and generating
          higher quality output for promising samples.
          Additionally we used two online services: The voice cloning service of the commercial platform <a
            href="https://elevenlabs.io/">Elevenlabs</a> and <a href="https://elf.tech/"> Elf.tech</a>. Elf.tech is a
          platform set up by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes">Grimes</a> an artist who embraced voice
          cloning technology early and makes her voice available for other producers through this platform,
          it even offers a distribution service for tracks created here.
          Below are some examples of timbre transferred snippets that we used in the final track. For the polyphonic
          examples (French Horn and Choir), the stems where seperated first and each voice transferred seperatly.

          <p>In order to create the visual part of this music video, it was important for us to create something that
            aligns with the contents of the music. We discussed a number of elements, including dancing, plants, and
            images of Greek mythology, and ink representing influences of generative AI. We aimed to blend these by
            using a combination of image and video generation, as well as video style transfer. The music outlines a
            contrast between humans and AI, gradually incorporating AI-generated components, until there is no human
            element left.
          </p>

            The mood board above has two parts. The left part represents the natural including humans and their struggle
            the right part represents the consequences of AI in the form of ink and natural disaster. In parallel to the
            gradual incorporation of AI-generated elements in the music, we gradually transition from a color scheme
            dominated by green to one dominated by purple.

            <p>We filmed parts of the video ourselves over the course of 3 days. Doing so allowed us more control over the material and the narrative of parts of our end product. By using video style transfer we could then still adjust the style of the footage to be consistent with the rest of the video. All material on these days was shot on a Canon EOS 700D DSLR camera. 
              We tried out various camera angles and movements in combination with the style transfer to see which parts worked best.  In case the style transfer failed, we still wanted our footage to be usable, so we filmed with different backgrounds. 
              Additionally, we took some background footage of plants, moss and water, that made their way into the video as fillers.

          <p>Here we will describe details of the video generation workflow we implemented using ComfyUI. Our pipeline applies style transfer to input video frames using various advanced neural network models and techniques, including multiple ControlNet modules, IPAdapter, AnimateDiffusion, and FreeU2. Below, we provide an overview of the workflow and a more in-depth explanation of each component and how they process the data.
             
          </p>
          <h4 class="title is-4">Overview</h4>

          <p>Our goal was to transform input videos by applying a desired artistic style extracted from a reference image. We achieved this by designing a ComfyUI workflow that integrates several components:
          </p>
          <br>
          <li>
            ControlNet Modules: Three separate ControlNet models are used to extract structural and motion information from the input video frames.
          </li>
          <li>
            IPAdapter: Integrates style features from the reference image into the generation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            AnimateDiffusion: Ensures temporal consistency across frames by modeling motion dynamics.
          </li>
          <li>
            FreeU2: Enhances image quality by refining details and reducing artifacts.
          </li>
        <br>
            By combining these components, our pipeline generates stylized videos that maintain the original motion while adopting the desired artistic style.

            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>We employed three ControlNet models, each serving a distinct purpose:          </p>
          <li>OpenPose ControlNet: Extracts pose information from the input frames to preserve the character's movements.</li>
          <li>Depth Map ControlNet: Captures depth information to maintain spatial consistency and realistic depth perception.</li>
          <li>HED Edge Detection ControlNet: Extracts edge information to retain fine details and outlines.</li>
          <br>
          <p>These models guide the generation process to ensure that the output frames closely match the structure and motion of the input video.</p>
          <h4 class="title is-4">IPAdapter</h4>
          <img src="static/images/ipadapt.png">
          <p>The IPAdapter goal is to integrate the style of the reference image into the generation process, which it does to a certain extent.
          </p>
          <h4 class="title is-4">AnimateDiffusion
          </h4>
          <p>AnimateDiffusion is used to model motion dynamics and ensure temporal consistency across frames. By incorporating a pre-trained motion model, it reduces flickering and maintains smooth transitions between adjacent frames.
          </p>
          <h4 class="title is-4">FreeU2
          </h4>
          <p>FreeU2 module enhances the overall image quality by refining details and reducing artifacts. It processes the generated frames to produce cleaner and more visually appealing results.

          <p>
            For the post-production of our music video, we utilized Adobe Premiere Pro as our primary editing platform. Central to this editing process was honoring the flow of the music. We tried to strike a balance between enhancing the musical elements as well as telling a narrative that, although aligned with the theme of the music, tells a slightly different story. Where the music tells the story of a battle between humans and AI, the video tells the story of the AI having a position of power over the humans, defeating them in the end. This balance was mostly upheld by editing in such a way that musical elements were underlined by for example switching between images on the beat, or highlighting key musical details by animating certain elements so that the focal point of the video aligned with those moments. This way we aimed to create a connection between auditory and visual components of the music video. 
	Our editing process was mostly iterative. We started compiling images and videos before the entirety of the plot was decided on. This way we were able to adapt when we were not able to generate a certain fragment we had in mind or change the narrative slightly if the AI tools we were using generated something that was different from what we originally expected to work with. We believe that this dynamic process was integral to the final end product. Before we started working on the project we decided not to let the AI generate everything, but rather see how we can incorporate AI elements within our own creative process. This way we aimed to achieve true collaboration between ourselves and AI tools.
